Doitblog is a open source static blog generator that doesn't get in your way, it just do it.

Static website should be as simple as editing html and css, and blogs should be 
as pleasent as writing on txt file or your favorite markdown.

By using pandoc, doitblog should be able to support your favorite markdown, mine is latex :D.

The blog itself is made by static html+css+js, and its never generated it only reads generated data, 
so you can easly change it or even remake it with your favorite spa framework.
